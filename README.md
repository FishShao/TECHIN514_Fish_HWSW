# Music Generator

Air Music is a gesture and breath based musical interaction system that allows users to create rhythm and sound using their body movements and exhalation, without relying on traditional musical instruments.

Instead of focusing on precise notes, the system emphasizes rhythm, intensity, and continuity, enabling expressive and accessible music-making through the body.

The system consists of a small wearable sensing device and an external sound-generating display device. The sensing device can be worn on the wrist or held in the hand, while a breath sensor captures exhalation. Together, hand motion and breath are used as expressive inputs to control sound output.
